Left to do: error handling (must have a food selection if they add a person, etc)

Clean up the RSVP code - pull it into reusable components, remove comments, etc

If I have free time, if they come back to edit and the person was a plus one, they could change the name of the plus one. doing this, they can't the way to do it would be knowing they have a plus one and then getting the user and making them a plus one
